# API Manager

This project is used to manage APIs. The goal is not to be a complete management tool, but to be a help for us to manage our APIs. So there is a simple list of all API interfaces, the possibility to monitor them, check the SSL certificates and document the relationship between the interfaces.

It is still under development and should not be used for productive purposes.
